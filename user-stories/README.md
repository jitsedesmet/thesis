# User stories

In [stories.md](stories.md) we introduce some functional requirements and user stories focussing on updates.

Since there the solid spec is a collection of multiple specifications working together, I cannot review it as a whole.
Instead, I will review each specification and state the relevance of that spec to the user story.
In the end, we hope to get a good understanding of what specs should be working together to conform to our requirements.

The different reviews of specifications are given in dedicated directories.  
We start with specifications focussing on access control:
* [WAC.md](access-control/WAC.md)
* [ACP.md](access-control/ACP.md)

Storage/linking specifications:
* [LDP.md](LDP.md).
* [TREE.md](TREE.md)

Data Discovery Specifications:
* [type-index.md](type-index.md)
* [shape-trees.md](shape-trees.md)

Varia specs:
* [linked-data-event-streams.md](linked-data-event-streams.md)
* [solid-interoperability.md](solid-interoperability.md)
* [sparql-endpoints.md](sparql-endpoints.md)
* [dedicated-ltqp-languages.md](dedicated-ltqp-languages.md)
