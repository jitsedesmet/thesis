In [stories.md](stories.md) we introduce some functional requirements and user stories focussing on updates.

Since there the solid spec is a collection of multiple specifications working together, I cannot review it as a whole.
Instead, I will review each specification and state the relevance of that spec to the user story.
In the end, we hope to get a good understanding of what specs should be working together to conform to our requirements.

The different reviews of specifications are given in dedicated directories.

* [WAC](access-control/WAC.md)

Data Discovery Specifications:
* [type-index](data-discovery/type-index.md)
* [shape-trees](data-discovery/shape-trees.md)

Query languages:
* [SPARQL](query-languages/SPARQL.md)
