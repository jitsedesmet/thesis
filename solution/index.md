title: Solution
---

In our [user stories](../user-stories/index.md) we discussed LDP to not be a well suited technology.
However, LDP is unlikely to disappear from the specification, and thus our solution should also work with it.

There would be two ways of thinking about an insert
1. I have a resource, where should I place it, and how should I change the indices?
2. I have a resource, I store it in the pod,
   what resources should link to my new resources, and how should I change the indices?
