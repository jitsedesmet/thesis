        Starting of, I'll announce that I changed my subject from
        "analyzing security when querying over decentralized environments"
        to "How can we abstract data updates in a permissioned decentralized environment behind a query abstraction layer."

        I will start by situating my thesis in the broader landscape.
        This will allow me to explain the research question better and introduce over the research hypothesis.
        When everyone understands the goals of my thesis, I will tell you what I've done so far to accomplish those goals.
        Ending of this presentation I take a glimpse at the future, going over the work that is still planned.

    <ul>
        <li>Decentralization Efforts
            (like <a href="https://solidproject.org/">Solid</a>
            <img style="height: 1em; transform: translate(0, 0.5em)" src="https://solidproject.org/assets/img/solid-emblem.svg" alt="Solid project icon">

                <li>Heterogeneity of Data<br>(I might have a smartwatch, you might not)</li>
                <li>Heterogeneity of Structure<br>(I sort pictures by date, you by location)</li>
            </ul>

        <li>Query Processing using SPARQL</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
        As of right now, data on the Web is increasingly centralized in organizations like Google and Amazon.
        This centralization is at the root of privacy scandals and acts as a vendor lock-in for consumers.
        Legislation like GDPR opens the path for the adoption of decentralization initiatives.
        One of the initiatives is Solid,
        and this initiative in particular is the talk of the town since the Flemish government heavily invests in it.
        Solid allows users to host their own data through something called a Solid Pod.
        Rooted in the Solid project is the belief that we should build upon the existing web technologies.
        A single Solid pod can thus be seen part of a node in a decentralized graph database, where each link in a pod can be any URI.
        Of course, users don't want just anyone to see all their data, and thus we need to add permission management,
        leaving us with a permisioned decentralized graph database.
        Since different users have different requirements, of their storage, different kinds of heterogeneity arise.
        In no particular order, we have the heterogeneity in interfaces, the heterogeneity of data and the heterogeneity of Structure.

        The sentiment of supporting heterogeneity is what sparked the creation of the Comunica query engine developed within this research unit.

    <h3>Situate Thesis: Solid Spec</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/">LDP</a> Interface (acts as a file system)</li>
        <li>Index
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://solid.github.io/type-indexes/">Type Index</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://shapetrees.org/">Shape Trees</a></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Query Processing using SPARQL
            <pre><code class="language-html">
SELECT DISTINCT * WHERE {
?item wdt:P31/wdt:P279* wd:Q16917;
wdt:P625 ?geo .
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
        To narrow the scope of my thesis I focus on the LDP interface because the Solid spec heavily relies on it.
        Without any indexing, data consumers would need to hard code their required data locations.
        To avoid this, the Solid spec describes two ways of indexing the data in a pod.
        One is the type index, the other one is shape trees.

        Now, to retrieve data, you access the index giving you a list of locations that are of interest to you.

        The LDP interface by itself allows you to read the whole web document and write to it.
        To ease the development experience, efforts exist to enable SPARQL queries over Solid pods.

        The focus of that research is about read-queries and there exists no research enabling update-queries.

    <h3>Research Question and Hypothesis</h3>
    <p>
        "How to

</span> in a

    </p>
    <div class="r-stack fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="1" style="border: red solid 2px; margin-top: 20px">
        <p class="fragment fade-in-then-out" data-fragment-index="1">
            Data consumers don't interact with the interfaces directly.
        </p>
        <p class="fragment fade-in-then-out" data-fragment-index="2">
            Data stores can reject the actions of data consumers.
        </p>
        <p class="fragment fade-in-then-out" data-fragment-index="3">
            Data stores are small, distributed, and the owner is in control.
        </p>
        <p class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="4">
            We use a query language (think SPARQL, SQL, ...) to add the abstraction.
        </p>
    </div>

    <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
        I therefore ask the question: "How to abstract data updates in a permissioned decentralized environment behind a query abstraction layer?"
        Let's investigate that question, in more detail ...

<section data-auto-animate>
    <h3>Research Question and Hypothesis</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The efforts of a developer to update data in a single data stores
            can be significantly lowered by adding a query abstraction layer.
        </li>
        <li>
            The efforts of a developer to update data in two data stores with the same interface,
            but different structures can be significantly lowered by adding a query abstraction layer.
        </li>
        <li>
            The number of additional http requests required by an update-query engine will be small (<10).
        </li>
    </ul>


    <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
        My hypothesis is...

        I will explain the metrics and measurements that I will use to validate or contradict the hypothesis in the section about the future.
