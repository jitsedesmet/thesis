    <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
        Data is very valuable.
        You often hear that data is the new gold.
        I gathered a few articles that state their own opinion on this.

        We have Deloitte stating that viewing data as a strategic asset is essential
        and that companies should organize their information system in such a way that the data they gather can be used as fuel.

        We also see Forbes comparing data to raw materials.
        They state that data acts as the raw building block for producing digital products.

        imec then states that data shouldn't be the new gold.
        Unlike gold, data can be shared by multiple parties at the same time.
        They therefore suggest that we should create data spaces instead of data silos so multiple people can benefit from data.

        Prof Sir Nigel Shadbolt and Sir Tim Berners-Lee share this vision stating that data should not be the new oil.
        Instead, it should be viewed as basic need, just like water.

        We can thus conclude that yes, data is essential, but that data should not be controlled by massive companies.
        This not only holds from an economic point of view, but also a social point of view.
        Where we see that the centralization of data in big centralized silos causes privacy related issues and social turbulence.

    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    <p>Decentralization initiatives</p>

    </ul>

    <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
        In response to social turbulence, privacy issues, and legislative means, various decentralization initiatives have been created.
        We list a few of these initiatives.
        All of them are unique in their own right, but we will be focussing on the first initiative since the flemish government heavily invests in it.

    <h1>Solid</h1>

        <li>Self Governed Data Store</li>
        <li>
            Heterogeneity
            <ul>
                <li>of Interface (SPARQL-endpoint, LDP, ...)</li>
                <li>of Data (I might have a smartwatch, you might not)</li>
                <li>of Structure (I sort pictures by date, you by location)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Theoretically: It's a permissioned decentralized graph database.
<!--            in which a single shard is self governed and no replication exists from a specification point of view.-->
        </li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
        Solid has some key ideas, it's a Web specification building ontop of existsing Web technologies.
        It providers every user with their own self governed data store.
        Given it's decentraliced nature, it needs to handle various kinds of heterogeinity.
        We can recognise three kinds: the heterogeinity of interface, of data and of structure.

        The collection of all solid data stores can be viewed as a large permissioned decentralized graph database.
        Unlike a distributed database that typically shards and replicates its data across multiple machines.
        The "Solid database" so to speak only shards it's data.

    <h3>Research Question and Hypothesis</h3>
    <p>
        "How can we
        <span class="fragment highlight-current-red" data-fragment-index="1">
abstract data updates
</span> over a
        <span class="fragment highlight-current-red" data-fragment-index="2">
document oriented interface
</span> of a
        <span class="fragment highlight-current-red" data-fragment-index="3">

</span>
        <span class="fragment highlight-current-red" data-fragment-index="4">
decentralized environment
</span>
        behind a
        <span class="fragment highlight-current-red" data-fragment-index="5">
query abstraction layer
</span>?"
    </p>
    <div class="r-stack fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="1" style="border: red solid 2px; margin-top: 20px">
        <p class="fragment fade-in-then-out" data-fragment-index="1">
            We aim to abstract the query process, so a developer does
            not need to interact with the pod interfaces directly.
        </p>
        <p class="fragment fade-in-then-out" data-fragment-index="2">
            The interface we interact with exposes data through HTTP documents.
            (The Solid specification describes the use of such an interface through LDP.)
        </p>
        <p class="fragment fade-in-then-out" data-fragment-index="3">
            Each HTTP resource has access rights configured, these rights can
            either grant or deny access to resources for specific users.
        </p>
        <p class="fragment fade-in-then-out" data-fragment-index="4">
            Each pod is self governed and limited rules apply to the system. A
            loosely defined system allows data publisher to be opinionated
        </p>
        <p class="fragment fade-in-then-out" data-fragment-index="5">
            We want the abstraction to happen through a declarative
            query. In this work we use the SPARQL query language but others could be used like GraphQL.
        </p>
        <p class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="6">
            We hypothesize that we can create an automated client capable of deciding where to store a resource given a pod.
            Such a client should have maximum execution time overhead of four times, and maximum double the HTTP requests.
        </p>
    </div>

    <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
        I therefore **ask the question**: "How can we abstract data updates over a document oriented interface of a permissioned decentralized environment behind a query abstraction layer?"
        Let's investigate that question, in more detail ...

        </div>
    </div>


    <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
        To create an automated client, we essentially need to figure out what files hold what data and why.


        Such a **file system can structure files in a variety of ways**.
        With the help of Shape Trees we can understand the structure.
        Shape Trees use shape descriptions like SHACL, or ShEx to describe resources.
        Put plainly, Shape trees are the **natural extension of shape descriptions to LDP**.
        Since "Shape Trees" provide structural information for read queries,
        they might be a good start to discover where we should write data.

        **Is this enough?**

        - *Resource Collection*: Corresponds to a group of RDF resources.
        - *Unstructured Collection*: Corresponds to a classical LDP container or HTTP resource.
        - *Structured Collection*: A canonical or derived collection. (below)
        - *Canonical Collection*: A resource collection containing resources.
        - *Derived Collection*: A resource collection that stores resources already stored by one or more other structured containers.
        - *Resource Description*: A way of describing resources, for example through ShEx or SHACL.
        - *Group Strategy*: A description of how resources should be grouped together, for example: my images are grouped per creation date.
        - *Store Condition*: When multiple collections are eligible to store a resource, the store condition decides what collection(s) actually store the resource. Allowing the creation of a store priority system.
        - *Update Condition*: Describes what to do when a containing resource is changed.
        - *Client Control*: Describes the amount of freedom a client has when trying to store a resource.

        1. The client gets the SGV description of the storage space (can be cached).
        2. The client checks all canonical collections and checks if the resource to be inserted matches a resource description of the collection.
        3. If the resource matches a description, the client checks the store condition of the description given the eligible collections.
        4. For each collection that stores the resource:
            1. The client checks the group strategy of the collection and groups the resource accordingly, deciding on the name of the new resource.
            2. The client checks the collections that are derived from this collection.
                Step 4 is executed for all collections that are derived from this collection, and the resource matches the description.
        5. The client performs the store operation.

        1. The client gets the SGV description of the storage space and the HTTP resource containing the updated RDF resource.
        2. The client virtually constructs the resource that would result from the requested operation.
        3. The client checks the update condition of the original matching resource description. The following action depends on the update condition.
        Typically, the update-condition will say whether an RDF resource is moved or not.
        4. Move required: remove the existing resource and follow the steps described in the create resource flow.
        5. No move required: just update the resource as requested by the user.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Creating an automated client with limited overhead is possible.</li>
        <li>Lack of server-side control might be an (inherent) problem</li>
        <li>Inter-pod Updates - What if I want to move data between pods?</li>
        <li>Other Interfaces - Is document oriented the best?</li>
        <li>View Creation and Discovery - Since structure has a high influence on execution time</li>
        <li>Smart Access control - Now that we know what a document is</li>
        <li>CAP / ACID - transaction / BASE - CRDTs</li>
    </ul>
