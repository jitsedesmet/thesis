## References

If ideas, words, sentences or charts are taken from someone else’s work and used or
paraphrased in the master’s dissertation, it is obliged by law to mention the original author: in
the text itself, immediately after the passage concerned, and in the reference list at the back
of the master’s dissertation.
Correct and complete references are extremely important and this should be taken into
account at the start of the implementation of the dissertation work. In doing so it can be
avoided that extra time and research is needed in order to complete the references when
finishing the dissertation.

As there are several styles for references (courantly used are APA and IEEE), each student
is advised to enquire with his/her supervisor which style is usual within the own discipline.
Online applications are often used such as My EndNote Web, LaTeX of BibTeX. Students
should choose a uniform style of reference.

Ordering the list of references can be done
- either in chronological order (the order as used in the text);
- or in alphabetical order by name of author.
