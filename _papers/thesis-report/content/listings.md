Charts and tables are either inserted in the text itself or are grouped in an annex.
Plans are folded to DIN A4 size and attached to the dissertation. If they are too voluminous
they can be grouped in a separate volume in the same format. The separate volumes then
carry on their cover and title pages the indication Volume I, Volume II.
It is not recommended to provide more than 2 volumes.
Each chart or table is given a number that can be used in the text to refer to it in an
unambiguous way. A short subtitle for the chart or table is strongly recommended
