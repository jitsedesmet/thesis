// Introduce

== Access Control
// I did look at it, but SGV does not touch it.


== Spec
// Do I mention Solid Application Interoperability? It describes things like: Don't go to deep into your container structure. That's a peculiar claim, since SGV does encourage nesting. -> SGV could be used to generate multiple views though (requires top-level SGV) -> That would result in a view a user sees vs a interop compatible view.


=== Interoperability

== LDP
// (Do I mention Tree/ LDES/ SPARQL endpoint as alternatives?)


=== Restrictions
// What's in a pod? And more

== Pod Descriptions

=== Type Index

=== Shape Tree
