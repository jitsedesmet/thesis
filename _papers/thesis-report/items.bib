The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs, allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every possible identifier. This specification does not define a generative grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual specifications of each URI scheme. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},

abstract = {We study the problem of containment of shape expression schemas ShEx for RDF graphs. We identify a subclass of ShEx that has a natural graphical representation in the form of shape graphs and whose semantics is captured with a tractable notion of embedding of an RDF graph in a shape graph. When applied to pairs of shape graphs, an embedding is a sufficient condition for containment, and for a practical subclass of deterministic shape graphs, it is also a necessary one, thus yielding a subclass with tractable containment. Containment for general shape graphs is EXP-complete. Finally, we show that containment for arbitrary ShEx is decidable.},
