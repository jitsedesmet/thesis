abstract = {We study the problem of containment of shape expression schemas ShEx for RDF graphs. We identify a subclass of ShEx that has a natural graphical representation in the form of shape graphs and whose semantics is captured with a tractable notion of embedding of an RDF graph in a shape graph. When applied to pairs of shape graphs, an embedding is a sufficient condition for containment, and for a practical subclass of deterministic shape graphs, it is also a necessary one, thus yielding a subclass with tractable containment. Containment for general shape graphs is EXP-complete. Finally, we show that containment for arbitrary ShEx is decidable.},
